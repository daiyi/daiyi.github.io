  * start a company with my friends — or be an early hire
  * do a nice thing for my coding communities in a bit way
- make a game!!
- spend some time digging around an area of computer science for a while. operating systems are pretty cool.

- live in a vehicle!
  * it might be a bus, it might be an ART BUS
      - russ is down to make an art bus
  * filled with gear
      - equipped for climbing, canyoning...????
  * and art supplies
  * form a caravan?
      - kwyn will caravan with me!

- live abroad, like actually live there

- Join a wilderness search & rescue organisation

- learn a language to speaking fluency
  - where fluency is defined as: able to express without frustration on the topics of morality, politics, emotions, and climbing
  - candidates: spanish, german
- reach speaking fluency in mandarin
  * I want to be able to talk about literally anything
  * no excuses, my mom is literally chinese and loves talking more than almost anything

- Have an excellent relationship with my parents, call frequently, visit home ever year!
  * I'd like to, perhaps over the course of years, talk with them about their lives. Maybe make a short comic about it (doesn't have to be nice enough to make public, it's just something I want to do).
- Birth a kid, the original hardcore sport

- Decide on a place to live for a couple years
- Decide on a place to live long-term.

- Race a triathlon
  * doesn't have to be a super legit one, I'm happy to do the shortest possible version of a triathlon, the accomplishment being accepting the responsibility of running even though I hate it
- Race a century
- Ski pretty confidently
- Ride motorcycles pretty confidently
- Learn how to actually debug bikes well

- I don't know how to maintain all of my friendships simultaneously. I'd like to become better at this. It might not be possible because time is finite, but it's something I think about often.

- I like being in meimei and olas' lives in some way, however small.

- Some causes I care about and would like to work on (probably through a job): enabling trust and encouraging a more gentle world, social sustainability, educational tools, new media/ways of interaction and education, developer tools, bringing people together/communities


### tricks

- hand stand longer than a couple seconds!
- I'd like to be able to do a couple more things on aerial silks
- one of these days I'll finally complete the splits in every direction
- PR at pushups and pull ups at THE SAME TIME (I'm currently convinced my pushup and pullup abilities are zero-sum)
- Do the slackline thing where you bounce onto the thing from a sitting position, wtf how does anyone even learn this


### art & writing

"publish" means polishing a work to the point where I'm satisfied with the quality, not necessarily formally putting it through a publisher and obtaining an isbn or something

- publish a travel sketchbook
- publish a collection of comics
- write a series on an interest technical topic, probably as blog posts

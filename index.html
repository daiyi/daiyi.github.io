        I was raised by the internet in a dreamy summer haze of oceans & deserts.
        I have the gnarliest sandle tan, the loudest laugh of any introvert, and the window into my soul is probably my eyebrows. I like climbing and drawing directly on nice paper with a pen because it makes me feel free.</p>
      <p>Some seasons in Berlin & many wilderness and roadside bivvies later I came back to living and working in California while playing in the local mountains, because it is easy and good.

      <p>This season I'm finally teaching myself to actually <b>ski</b>, mostly by watching youtube videos, perhaps followed by obtaining my own touring gear (?!?). Honestly just trying to decide if I want to go all in on backcountry snow sports! Also lots of reading and dreaming for the upcoming <b>high sierra season</b>. I'm excited to have a focus and set real goals with a dedicated training partner. I'm apprehensive that being <b>committed about climbing</b> will only lead to resentment towards full-time employment and the ecosystem of life choices that must accompany it (I have enough thoughts about being conned into the vicious cycle of the middle-class treadmill as it is), but we'll see if I can make it work this time. From the other side I can safely marvel at the magic of feeling assured in your career/financial future, would highly recommend investing in that 10/10.</p>
      <p>I recently picked up a book on <b>urban watercolour sketching</b> from the library to brush up on fundamentals and have been inspired to get out on the street with my kit more, which will pair nicely with the lengthening daylight (which I am EXTREMELY EXCITED FOR EVERY YEAR \o/).</p>
      <p>I continue to fall into rabbit holes and churn out <b>zines</b> as an enthusiastic <a href="https://distractibility.github.io">distractibility cartographer</a>.</b>
      <p>I'm kind of at a standstill with <b>spanish</b> and have been unable to find the energy to wedge a vocab-drilling session back into my daily routine since my commute changed. My tired-mode default is podcasts, so I found some interesting science/music spanish shows to listen to at 0.8x speed while I recover from mental overcommitment.</p>
      <p>I casually revived my sourdough starter from its fridge exile and made a couple of pretty decent <b>sourdough pizza</b>. I also have been making my own hummus and yogurt. Feeling like I can afford to wastefully hand-stretching my own noodles and prepare my own pickles makes me feel powerful, as if I am the entire master of my own time (even though I lease most of my waking hours to a job).</p>
      <p>Philip lent me his <b>guitar</b> with the intent of launching me into my musical dreams but I have yet to get that far down in the stack of things I can possibly cram into 4 (!!) hours of "free" time per day, so I am still playing guitar like a ukulele.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in any of that, I am feeling decently social and would be keen to <a href="#contact">chat</a> digitally or in person (:</p>

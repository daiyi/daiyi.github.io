        <h2>I am a visual artist, hitchhiker, and technomancer.
          <small>Things I'm good at: writing code & drawing shit and having an uncomfortably overactive imagination. </small>
        </h2>
        <p>Currently learning: crack climbing, cycling infinite distances, database magickery</p>
        <p>I seriously can't remember the last time I wasn't sleep deprived and on the verge of death. About 15% of my daily willpower allotment goes towards preventing myself from drilling many holes into my room or disappearing forever with only a laptop, sleeping bag and art supplies. My life is a trust fall into humanity’s arms. Intersectionality and inclusion are important to me. The sharing economy is the only thing I’m idealistic about, and I like to think about how communities form and grow. I love to learn and I love to teach. Let’s make a collaboration.</p>
        <p>I'm communicable via <a href="mailto:daiyitastic@gmail.com">email</a> & <a href="https://twitter.com/daiyitastic" target="blank">twitter</a> & real life. Currently based in Berlin.</p>
        <p>I'm on the internet: <a href="http://blog.daiyi.co">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.trustroots.org/profile/daiyi">trustroots</a>, <a href="https://github.com/daiyiwhale">github</a></p>
        <p align="center">---</p>
        <p>Other interests: machine learning, vision science, design, open-water swimming, climbing, being really fucking adaptable, ultralight backpacking, cycling, free economy, video games, intentional communities.</p>
        <p>Places I &lt;3: US West Coast, Californian High Sierras, Spanish Pyrenees, Patagonia, Northern Thailand</p>
        <p>Places I'm going: South America, Iceland, Germany, Swiss Alps</p>
